    "Construction:\n",
    "\n",
    "A contingency matrix is typically a square matrix where the rows represent the true class labels, and the columns represent the predicted class labels.\n",
    "Each cell in the matrix contains the count of instances that belong to a particular combination of true and predicted class labels.\n",
    "For a binary classification problem, a contingency matrix would have a 2x2 structure, with two rows (true classes) and two columns (predicted classes).\n",
    "For multi-class classification, the matrix size would depend on the number of classes.\n",
    "Evaluation Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "From the contingency matrix, several performance metrics can be derived to evaluate the classification model's performance, including:\n",
    "Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total number of instances.\n",
    "Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.\n",
    "Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances in the dataset.\n",
    "F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of model performance.\n",
    "Specificity: The proportion of true negative predictions out of all actual negative instances in the dataset.\n",
    "False Positive Rate (FPR): The proportion of false positive predictions out of all actual negative instances in the dataset.\n",
    "False Negative Rate (FNR): The proportion of false negative predictions out of all actual positive instances in the dataset.\n",
    "Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Contingency matrices can also be visualized using heatmaps or other graphical representations to provide a more intuitive understanding of the classification model's performance.\n",
    "Visual inspection of the matrix can help identify patterns, such as misclassifications or class imbalances, that may require further investigation or model improvement.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the values in the contingency matrix and derived performance metrics helps assess the strengths and weaknesses of the classification model.\n",
    "It provides insights into which classes are being predicted correctly or incorrectly and helps identify areas for model improvement, such as addressing class imbalances, adjusting decision thresholds, or selecting different features."
